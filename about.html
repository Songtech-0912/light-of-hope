            <p>In the centuries that followed, the concept of karma changed from sacramental rituals to actual human
                action that builds and serves society and human existence</p>

            <p>Hope is an optimistic state of mind that is based on an expectation of positive outcomes with respect to
                events and circumstances in one's life or the world at large.
                As a verb, its definitions include: "expect with confidence" and "to cherish a desire with
                anticipation."</p>

            <p>As a specialist in positive psychology, Snyder studied how hope and forgiveness can impact several
                aspects of life such as health, work, education, and personal meaning. He postulated that there are
                three main things that make up hopeful thinking:</p>

            <p>In other words, hope was defined as the perceived capability to derive pathways to desired goals and
                motivate oneself via agency thinking to use those pathways.</p>

            <p>Snyder argues that individuals who are able to realize these three components and develop a belief in
                their ability are hopeful people who can establish clear goals, imagine multiple workable pathways
                toward those goals, and persevere, even when obstacles get in their way.</p>

            <p>Contemporary philosopher Richard Rorty understands hope as more than goal setting, rather as a
                metanarrative, a story that serves as a promise or reason for expecting a better future. Rorty as
                postmodernist believes past meta–narratives, including the Christian story, utilitarianism, and Marxism
                have proved false hopes; that theory cannot offer social hope; and that liberal man must learn to live
                without a consensual theory of social hope.</p>

            <p>Snyder's theory uses hope as a mechanism that is most often seen in psychotherapy. In these instances,
                the therapist helps their client overcome barriers that have prevented them from achieving goals. The
                therapist would then help the client set realistic and relevant personal goals (i.e. "I am going to find
                something I am passionate about and that makes me feel good about myself"), and would help them remain
                hopeful of their ability to achieve these goals, and suggest the correct pathways to do so.</p>

            <p>While the nature of the goals in Snyder's model differ with those in Herth's model, they both view hope
                as a way to maintain personal motivation, which ultimately will result in a greater sense of optimism.

            <p>Hope is a powerful protector against chronic or life-threatening illnesses. A person’s hope (even when
                facing an illness that will likely end their life), can be helpful by finding joy or comfort. It can be
                created and focused on achieving life goals, such as meeting grandchildren or attending a child’s
                wedding. Hope can be an opportunity for us to process and go through events, that can be traumatic. A
                setback in life, an accident, or our own final months of living can be times when hope is comfort and
                serves as a pathway from one stage to the next.</p>

            <p>The inclusion of hope in treatment programs has potential in both physical and mental health settings.
                Hope as a mechanism for improved treatment has been studied in the contexts of PTSD, chronic physical
                illness, and terminal illness, among other disorders and ailments.</p>
